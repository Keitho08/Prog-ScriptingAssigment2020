    "**Background to Random Numbers**  \n",
    "A random number is not neccessarily a different number every time, but rather a number that cannot be predicted logically. As computers operate on programs which are a definitive set of instructions, it therefore implies there must be some algorthim to generate a random number as well, thus these numpers are not truly random, even though to most humans they will appear to be so. Generally under normal circumstances humans do not require truly random numbers except for specific applications such as encryption keys for security, gambling games such as digital roulette wheel's etc. to prevent hackers cheating. \n",

    "Random numbers in a computer are generally generated via an algorithim called pseudo random. Pseudo random as defined by Google dictionary, are numbers that satisfy one or more statistical tests for randomness but are produced by a definitive mathematical procedure. In order to generate truly random numbers hardware our information from an outside source to the computer is generally required. Pseudo Random Number Generators are usually referred to by the acronymn **PRNG**, whilst True Random Number Generators are referred to as **TRNG**. A great example how the internet security company Cluodfare utilise lava lamps to create TRN's is available at; https://www.wired.com/story/cloudflare-lava-lamps-protect-from-hackers/. Using a camera to photograph movement of lava lamp movements true random numbers can be created. This notebook will focus on PRNG in NumPy, however it is important before we go further to understand the limitations of PRNGs. \n",

    "NumPy is a freely available open source software. The lead co-founder of NumPy was Travis Oliphant. It was officially relased in version 1.0 in October 2006 which had evolved from an orginal module called numeric written in 1995. The sotware is free to download at http://numpy.scipy.org. NumPy is one of the most fundamental and widely used Python packages that is widely used for machine learning research and other scientific and mathematical computing tasks. In addition to the mathematical and scientifc taskts, NumPy is also used to generate random numbers that serve various different requirements in computer science. \n",

    "Random number generation is a significant element of modern scientifc computing tasks. Numpy comes complete with a standard library of random number generators for both continuous[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1) and discrete[<sup>2</sup>](#fn2) type data. \n",
    "Real world examples of where there numpy random generation package may be used include simulation and modelling of data sets, such as the Iris flower data set where random numbers between certain intervals could be used to predict a species type. Another example is sports analytics where random numbers could be inputted to determine predicted output as per the case study available at numpy.org[<sup>3</sup>](#fn3). In computers games development random numbers could be used for many applications fo example to simulate dodging a random bullet or drawing a card from a deck. We will look at examples of the NumPy random generation module further in the following sections of this report.\n",

    "The poisson distribution is a anoth example of a discrete data distribution. It estimates the probability an event can happen based on rate of number of occurences. \n",
    "\n",
    "The poisson distribution is called using np.random.poisson, where numpy is imported as np. It has two main parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* lam - the rate or known number of occurences\n",
    "* size - the size of the array\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example we will look at another real world scenario. The scenario is that a wind farm developer is trying to determine if an area in Shannon Co. Clare will have adequate wind speeds to site the wind farm. We are at early stage in the project and the limitation of the study will be a high level desktop review of the wind data available from historical records. \n",
    "The main criteria for selection of the site will be the wind speed. The minimum wind speed required by the developer for the turbine to generate electrictity ais 12.5 kilometres per hour (kph) and to make the investment attractive for the developer this wind speed should be achieved for greater than 75% of the year.\n",
    "The historical data has shown the average wind speed in Shannon between 1980 to 2010 was 16.9kph. We will now input this value into a poisson function to determine likelihood of wind speeds in this area. "

    "An exponential distribution is often used to represent the prediction of a time period until a specific event occurs. Popular examples include time between earthquakes, the duration a person spends on a website etc. An exponential distribution has two parameters:\n",

    "* scale - iverse of rate which has a default of 1.0\n",
    "* size - the shape of the array\n",
